export const aboutMe1 = `I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for coding,
hacking, and solving problems. I started this journey in my early teenage years
to hack video-games, realizing that with coding I could hack, improve and create
awesome stuff. My passion quickly evolved into creating software to help my
parents' business and into pursuing a degree in CS in the US, winning Hackathons
and doing startups.`;

export const aboutMe2 = `I'm now a seasoned hacker, full-stack and mobile
developer with years of experience in several languages. While my experise is
in complete Full Stack development, the area I currently have the most fun is in
Front-End Engineering, building complex apps with React, with Redux or GraphQL.`;


// My area of expertise is
// MEAN full-stack development: from UI/UX to REST-full API back-end and a pioneer
// in Multi-tier MVC design pattern.
